<p>Nature was derived from the Latin word Natura, which actually means birth.

This was actually a Greek translation from the word physis which actually relates to intrinsic characteristics like animals, plants and the other features of the world that have developed on its own accord.

The word nature has been used for various uses today and it mostly depicts wildlife and geology. Nature usually refers to general realms that have not been altered by man like beaches, forests, rocks, wild animals, mountains hills etc when compared to manmade items like manufactured goods.

Nature also makes one feel to things that have its own beauty and origin and which have not been changed, or altered to get it more better. Something that has happened naturally is what is most commonly referred to being as natural.</p>
